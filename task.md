## Background

At Lendsqr, many of our lenders use our mobile apps to reach over half a million customers. At this scale, we use NodeJS with TypeScript as its backend software development stack which allows us to rapidly ideate and release features and functionality.

To prepare for you as a possible backend engineer at Lendsqr, we would require that you create an application using NodeJS with TypeScript. This test will allow us to assess your strengths and weaknesses.

This assessment is not for entry level engineers but for intermediate and above. At the minimum, you must have solid proficiencies in TypeScript, NodeJS, and MySQL. Please do not attempt this assessment if you are not confident of your skills to deliver as it would be a waste of your time.

## Assessment

Demo Credit is a mobile lending app that requires wallet functionality. This is needed as borrowers need a wallet to receive the loans they have been granted and also send the money for repayments.

You are required to build an MVP (Minimum viable product) wallet service where:

- A user can create an account
- A user can fund their account
- A user can transfer funds to another userâ€™s account
- A user can withdraw funds from their account.

## Your task is to present

A readme design document for your implementation
An implementation of the project (NodeJS API using TypeScript)
You may not bother about building a full authentication system, a faux token based authentication will suffice.
Ensure to write unit tests for the project

This assessment is to test your competence and none of the code would be used within Lendsqr.
